abstract: |
  Peripheral sensory organs and ganglia found in the vertebrate head arise during embryonic
  development from distinct ectodermal thickenings, called cranial sensory placodes
  (adenohypophyseal, olfactory, lens, trigeminal, epibranchial, and otic). A series of
  patterning events leads to the establishment of these placodes. Subsequently, these placodes
  undergo specific morphogenetic movements and cell-type specification to shape the final
  placodal derivatives and generate the differentiated cell types required for their function.
  In this chapter, we focus on recent studies in the zebrafish that have advanced our
  understanding of cranial sensory placode development. We summarize the signaling events and
  their molecular effectors guiding the formation of the preplacodal region, and the subsequent
  subdivision of this region along the anteroposterior axis that gives rise to specific placode
  identities. We also describe the processes controlling morphogenesis and neurogenesis, and
  highlight experimental approaches used in zebrafish to precisely label cell populations,
  follow their development, and characterize cell fates within specific placodes.

summary: |
  Review of the molecular, developmental, and methodological foundations of cranial sensory
  placode formation, morphogenesis, and neurogenesis in zebrafish.
