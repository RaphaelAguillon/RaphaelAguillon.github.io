# Full abstract
abstract: |
  The zebrafish olfactory epithelium comprises a variety of neuronal populations that have
  traditionally been assigned distinct embryonic origins. For example, while ciliated sensory
  neurons arise from the preplacodal ectoderm (PPE), previous lineage-tracing studies proposed
  that both Gonadotropin releasing hormone 3 (Gnrh3) neurons and microvillous sensory neurons
  derive from cranial neural crest (CNC). We find that expression of Islet1/2 is restricted to
  Gnrh3 neurons associated with the olfactory epithelium. Unexpectedly, Islet1/2+ cell numbers
  remain unchanged in sox10 mutant embryos, challenging their proposed CNC origin. Using
  lineage reconstruction based on time-lapse confocal imaging and confirmed by photoconversion,
  we show that Gnrh3 neurons derive from the anterior PPE. Similarly, all traced microvillous
  sensory neurons also originate from preplacodal progenitors. Our results demonstrate that
  rather than arising from separate ectodermal sources, cell-type heterogeneity in the early
  olfactory epithelium is generated from overlapping pools of progenitors within the preplacodal
  ectoderm.

# Short homepage summary
summary: |
  Sensory neuron diversity in the zebrafish olfactory epithelium arises from overlapping
  progenitor pools within the preplacodal ectoderm.
