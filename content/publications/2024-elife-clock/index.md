abstract: |
  The circadian clock enables anticipation of the day/night cycle in animals ranging from
  cnidarians to mammals. Circadian rhythms are generated through a transcription-translation
  feedback loop (TTFL or pacemaker) with CLOCK as a conserved positive factor in animals. However,
  CLOCK’s functional evolutionary origin and mechanism of action in basal animals are unknown. In
  the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, pacemaker gene transcript levels, including NvClk (the Clock
  ortholog), appear arrhythmic under constant darkness, questioning the role of NvCLK. Utilizing
  CRISPR/Cas9, we generated a NvClk allele mutant (NvClkΔ), revealing circadian behavior loss
  under constant dark (DD) or light (LL), while maintaining a 24 hr rhythm under light-dark
  condition (LD). Transcriptomics analysis revealed distinct rhythmic genes in wild-type
  (WT) polyps under LD compared to DD conditions. In LD, NvClkΔ/Δ polyps exhibited comparable numbers of rhythmic
  genes, but were reduced in DD. Furthermore, under LD, the NvClkΔ/Δ polyps showed alterations in
  temporal pacemaker gene expression, impacting their potential interactions. Additionally, differential
  expression of non-rhythmic genes associated with cell division and neuronal differentiation
  was observed. These findings revealed that a light-responsive pathway can partially compensate for
  circadian clock disruption, and that the Clock gene has evolved in cnidarians to synchronize rhythmic
  physiology and behavior with the diel rhythm of the earth’s biosphere.

summary: |
  Cnidarian CLOCK already synchronizes molecular rhythms with daily light cycles.
