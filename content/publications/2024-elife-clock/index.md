abstract: |
  We trace the evolutionary emergence of the circadian gene CLOCK in cnidarians and show
  that it already acted as a core regulator synchronizing internal molecular rhythms with diel
  environmental light cues. Combining transcriptional profiling, functional perturbations, and
  behavioral analysis, we demonstrate that cnidarian CLOCK integrates environmental timing
  with cellular physiology.

summary: |
  Cnidarian CLOCK already synchronizes molecular rhythms with daily light cycles.
