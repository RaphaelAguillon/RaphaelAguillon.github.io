# Full abstract
abstract: |
  Sense organs acquire their distinctive shapes concomitantly with the
  differentiation of sensory cells and neurons necessary for their function.
  Although our understanding of the mechanisms controlling morphogenesis and
  neurogenesis in these structures has grown, how these processes are coordinated
  remains largely unexplored. Neurogenesis in the zebrafish olfactory epithelium
  requires the bHLH proneural transcription factor Neurogenin 1 (Neurog1).
  To address whether Neurog1 also controls morphogenesis, we analysed the migratory
  behaviour of early olfactory neural progenitors in neurog1 mutant embryos. Our
  results indicate that the oriented movements of these progenitors are disrupted
  in this context. Morphogenesis is similarly affected by mutations in the chemokine
  receptor gene cxcr4b, suggesting it is a potential Neurog1 target gene. We find
  that Neurog1 directly regulates cxcr4b through an E-box cluster located just
  upstream of the cxcr4b transcription start site. Our results suggest that
  proneural transcription factors, such as Neurog1, directly couple distinct
  aspects of nervous system development.
