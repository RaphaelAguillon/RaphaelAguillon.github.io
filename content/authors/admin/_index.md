bio: |
  I am an integrative biologist studying how organisms sense, encode, and respond to 
  environmental variation. My work combines chronobiology, developmental biology, 
  eco-evo-devo, and genomic systems approaches. I investigate how light, temperature, 
  and stress reshape transcriptional architecture, neural development, and physiology 
  across scales — from diatoms to cnidarians and vertebrates.

## About

I am an integrative biologist exploring how environmental cues — light–dark cycles, 
temperature variation, metabolic and DNA stress — shape cellular decisions, gene 
regulatory networks and organismal behaviour.  
My work combines circadian systems biology in *Phaeodactylum tricornutum* with 
developmental and behavioural chronobiology in cnidarians, aiming to uncover how 
rhythms emerge, evolve, break, and reorganize across marine ecosystems.

Across my career I have moved between embryology (*Danio rerio*), 
eco-devo-physiology (*Nematostella vectensis*, *Cassiopea*), and transcriptional network 
analysis in diatoms — developing an approach that links molecules, cells, physiology, 
behaviour, and ecology.

Outside the lab I practice movement training, yoga flow and Gaga dance, which help me 
stay attuned to embodied perception and balance in both science and life.
