## About

I am an integrative biologist exploring how environmental cues — light–dark cycles,
temperature variation, and cellular stress — shape gene regulatory networks,
development, and behaviour. My work spans embryology in zebrafish, sleep and
chronobiology in cnidarians, and circadian transcriptional networks in diatoms.

Across my career I have moved between developmental biology, chronobiology, and
eco-evo-devo, building an approach that links molecular pathways, cellular decisions,
organismal physiology, and ecosystem function.

Outside the lab, I practice movement training, yoga flow, and Gaga dance, which help
me keep an embodied, balanced perspective on science and mentoring.
