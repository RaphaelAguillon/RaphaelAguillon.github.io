Raphaël Aguillon is an integrative biologist whose work bridges marine chronobiology, eco-evo-devo, and
environmental physiology. He studies how organisms—from diatoms to cnidarians—sense and encode
environmental variation such as light, temperature, and DNA stress, and how these cues reshape gene
regulatory networks, development, and behaviour.

He is currently a postdoctoral scientist at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique (CNRS, Paris),
working on the circadian system of *Phaeodactylum tricornutum*, with a focus on transcriptional
architecture, promoter logic, and gene regulatory network dynamics.

Before joining IBPC, Raphaël spent over five years in Israel investigating molecular and behavioural
rhythms in cnidarians, leading to a **Nature Communications** paper demonstrating that DNA damage
modulates sleep drive in animals lacking a centralized nervous system.

His research philosophy centres on multi-scale integration—from molecules to ecological function—
forming the basis of his long-term vision for a research group in eco-devo-physiology.

Outside the lab, Raphaël practices Gaga dance, movement training, and regular sport as a way to stay
attuned to embodied perception and balance.
