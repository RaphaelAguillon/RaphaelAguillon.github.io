summary: "Invited talk for the Azrieli Fellows Program exploring the evolutionary origins of sleep and its relationship to neural complexity."
abstract: |
  In this talk I discuss how sleep appears in animals with and without centralized nervous
  systems, and what this reveals about the evolutionary relationship between sleep, cellular
  maintenance, and brain complexity. Using cnidarian models and vertebrate comparisons, I
  outline how sleep-like states emerge, how they can be quantified, and how molecular pathways
  related to stress and DNA damage connect to behavioural rest.
